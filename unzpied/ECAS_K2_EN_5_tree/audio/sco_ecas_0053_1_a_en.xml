Depending on the installed variant of the ECAS ECU, two additional driving levels II and III can be defined via parameterizing, or a driving level II plus an unloading level. All these level are specified in counts, as differences to driving level I.
</au>
<au ref="2">
The driving levels II and III are triggered by a switch, using the ECAS remote-control unit or - in the case of driving level II - depending on the vehicle speed.
</au>
<au ref="3">
These different driving levels are addressed at higher speeds for instance, to save fuel due to the reduced air resistance.
