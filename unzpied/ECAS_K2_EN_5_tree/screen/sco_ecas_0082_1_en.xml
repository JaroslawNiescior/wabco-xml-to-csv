This is OK so far.</tf>

What has to be done, when during raising the superstructure the count values of a height sensor are decreasing?</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb1" fs="13" x="984.45" y="139.85" wi="226" he="20">
No, this is not possible.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="985.45" y="184.85" wi="278" he="19">
No, this way the problem is not solvable.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="990.45" y="245.85" wi="304" he="56">
During raising the superstructure the count values must increase. Thereto the lever of the height sensor has to be mounted the other way around.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="986.45" y="318.85" wi="210" he="19">
No, this cannot be the reason.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb5" fs="13" x="988.45" y="353.85" wi="354" he="52">
No, during raising the superstructure the count values must increase. Otherwise the ECU detects a so called "plausibility error".</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb6" fs="13" x="987.45" y="1.85" wi="351" he="52">
Exactly. During raising the superstructure also the count values must increase. Thereto the lever of the height sensor has to be mounted the other way around.</tf>
