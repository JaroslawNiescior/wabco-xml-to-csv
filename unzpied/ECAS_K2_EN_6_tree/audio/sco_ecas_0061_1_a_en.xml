<au ref="1">
ECAS already includes a lifting axle control. Via a pressure sensor or a pressure switch connected to one of the supporting bellows of the main axle, the ECU detects during loading when the permissible axle load is exceeded. In this case the lifting axle is automatically lowered.
</au>
<au ref="2">
For safety reasons, a raised lifting axle may be also automatically lowered, when the ignition is switched off. This is en- or disabled by parameterizing.
</au>
<au ref="3">
If the system is equipped with a pressure sensor, a function called "fully automatic lifting axle" can be activated. In this case the lifting axle is also automatically raised during unloading.
</au>
<au ref="4">
Otherwise the lifting axle is manually raised, using a switch or the ECAS remote-control unit.
