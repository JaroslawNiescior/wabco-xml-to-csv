When the vehicle is unladen the ride clearance is greater than when loaded.</tf>

This function enshures that the ground clearance is sufficient even when the tyre pressure is low.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="3" fs="13" x="189.85" y="264.5" wi="342.1" he="35">
Thus the shipping space of a trailer can be a bit larger as it could be without this ECAS function.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="4" fs="13" x="189.85" y="328.5" wi="340.1" he="35">
Due to this function the overall height of the loaded vehicle is smaller than when unladen.</tf>

Please mark the right statements about the ECAS function "tyre deflection compensating".</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb1" fs="13" x="1002.45" y="16.85" wi="365" he="61">
This statement is true. The ride clearance is increased by the same value as the tyres are deflected due to the load weight.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="116.85" wi="372" he="51.5">
This statement is wrong. The tyre deflection compensating serves the aim to increase the height of the shipping space.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="1009.45" y="193.85" wi="346" he="53">
This is correct. If the vehicle is unladen the ride clearance is kept very short to enable an increased overall height.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="1011.45" y="259.85" wi="330" he="35">
That´s not true. The overall height remains the same regardless of the load weight.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb5" fs="13" x="1002.45" y="-69.1" wi="331" he="25">
Exactly, you marked all right statements.</tf>
