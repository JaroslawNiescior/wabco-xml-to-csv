<au ref="1">
During calibration of the height sensors the so called upper level and lower level are specified, also referred to as stop levels.
</au>
<au ref="2">
When during a control process one of these limits has been reached the ECAS ECU immediately aborts any change in the level.
</au>
<au ref="3">
The distances of these levels from the mechanical stops is freely selectable. Thus the limiting cables or other height limit stops can be protected.
