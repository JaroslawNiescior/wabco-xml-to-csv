<au ref="1">
Using the height sensors ECAS detects the current distance between the chassis and the axle.
</au>
<au ref="2">
The height sensor is mounted to the chassis and is connected to the axle via a lever and a linkage .
</au>
<au ref="3">
Changings of the level result in corresponding changes of the lever position.
</au>
<au ref="4">
When the sensor is installed it has to be ensured that its lever can freely move across the whole range of possible levels.
</au>
<au ref="5">
The length of the lever has to be chosen in such a way, that only the range of plus / minus 50 degrees around the zero position is used. The zero position is determined by the so called fixing hole.
