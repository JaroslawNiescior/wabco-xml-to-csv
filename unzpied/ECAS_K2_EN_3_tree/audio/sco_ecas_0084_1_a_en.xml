<au ref="2">
This ECAS rear axle valve is able to pressurize or vent the left and the right supporting bellows of a rear axle, according to the control commands of the ECAS ECU.

<au ref="3">
When 2 height sensors have been installed, the superstructure can be kept parallel to the axle even when the load is one-sided. To do so, different pressures are used for the bellows on the left and right . This in also referred to as 2-point-control.
