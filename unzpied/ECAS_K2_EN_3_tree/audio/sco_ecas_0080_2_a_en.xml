<au ref="1">
The armature inside of the coil is equipped on one side with a ferrite core. The coil is partially enclosed by a sheet of iron and generates during operationan electrical field.
</au>
<au ref="2">
When the coil with the ferrite core is turned into the field, the inductance is increased, the inverse movement reduces the inductance.
This sensor is to be tested in the same way as the conventional sensor.
