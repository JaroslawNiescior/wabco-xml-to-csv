<au ref="1">
When using a 1-point control the distance between the superstructure and an axle is measured at one point only, using only one height sensor.
</au>
<au ref="2">
The supporting bellows on the left and the right are connected via the solenoid valve. Therefore the pressure on both sides is equal.
</au>
<au ref="3">
This control principle takes place at the most semitrailers: even with 3 axles, one height sensor is sufficient in this case. It is mostly mounted at the middle axle.
When applying such a 1-point control a slant of the superstructure caused by uneven load distribution cannot be prevented.
