<au ref="1">
The basis function of ECAS is the regulation of a reference level.
</au>
<au ref="2">
A reference level is specified as a predefined distance between the axle and the chassis of the vehicle.
</au>
<au ref="3">
In the case of ECAS reference levels are defined in several ways:
</au>
<au ref="4">
During calibration a driving level is specified as the reference level when the vehicle is in motion.
</au>
<au ref="5">
Using parameterizing, further alternatively selectable driving levels can be specified as reference levels.
</au>
<au ref="6">
And using the remote control unit any desired reference level can be defined and addressed.
