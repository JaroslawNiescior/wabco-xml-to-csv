This is the diagram of an ECAS system for a semitrailer equipped with a lifting axle.
The main components of the system are in the first place the ECAS ECU ...
</au>
<au ref="2">
which is powered via the ABS or the EBS ECU.
</au>
<au ref="3">
Further the ECAS valve block for the rear and lifting axles, which pressurizes or vents all supporting bellows ...
</au>
<au ref="4">
... as well as the lifting bellows to raise and lower the lifting axle. Only one of them is depicted here.
</au>
<au ref="5">
The actual level of the load platform is measured by only one centrally placed height sensor.
</au>
<au ref="6">
The ECAS warning lamp is switched on, as soon as the superstructure left the driving level, or in the case of a failure.
</au>
<au ref="7">
Finally, a pressure sensor detects the bellows pressure of the main axle. When this pressure exceeded a parameterized value, the lifting axle may be automatically lowered. When falling below a certain bellows pressure, it may be automatically raised.
