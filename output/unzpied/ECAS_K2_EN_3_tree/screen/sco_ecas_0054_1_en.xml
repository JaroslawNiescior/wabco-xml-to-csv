The height of the driving level is specified by the vehicle manufacturer, as the reference level for optimal driving characteristics.</tf>

That´s wrong. Driving levels are desired or reference levels during driving. The actual level may deviate more or less from it, e.g. caused by a bumpy road.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="101.85" wi="371" he="28">
This statement is true, that´s the characteristic of driving level I.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="1005.45" y="152.85" wi="352" he="57">
That´s true. The driving level specified by the manufacturer has to be stored in the ECU when calibrating the height sensors.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="241.85" wi="307" he="39">
This statement is true. The driving levels II and III are always specified in relationship to driving level I.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb5" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="301.85" wi="359" he="51.5">
That´s correct. In many cases the driving level II is addressed automatically when exceeding a certain speed threshold.</tf>

Exactly, you checked the right statements.</tf>
