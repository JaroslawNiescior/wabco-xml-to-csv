This statement is correct, it describes the main task of the ECAS ECU.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="1004.45" y="74.85" wi="353" he="51.5">
That is wrong. The program is stored in a ROM module of the ECU and cannot be changed after delivery.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="1005.45" y="150.85" wi="333" he="52">
This statement is wrong. The parameters are stored in a writable memory and can be changed any time by means of the PC diagnosis.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="1010.45" y="227.85" wi="306" he="51.5">
That´s true. By means of PC diagnosis stored messages can be read and parameters can be changed.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb5" fs="13" x="1002.45" y="-69.1" wi="376" he="23">
This is correct. You recognized the two right statements.</tf>
