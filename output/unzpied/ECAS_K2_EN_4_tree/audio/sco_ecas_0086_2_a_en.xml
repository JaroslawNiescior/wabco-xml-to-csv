The rear axle block on the left and the lifting axle block on the right are pictured here side by side. In reality the lifting axle block is flange mounted in such a way, that the chambers A to C of the two blocks are close together.
</au>
<au ref="2">
Let's look at first to the raising and lowering when the lifting axle is lowered, which can be seen at the vented lifting bellow on the right.
</au>
<au ref="3">
To pressurize the supporting bellows, the solenoid for the central pressurizing and venting is actuated first. Due to this the lower champers of the rear axle block are supplied with compressed air.
</au>
<au ref="4">
When now the two other solenoids of the rear axle valve are energized, the ports 21 and 22 to the supporting bellows are connected to air supply, and the bellows are vented. Simultanuously the supporting bellows of the lifting axle are vented, because the chambers A and B of both blocks are connected.
</au>
<au ref="5">
When the solenoids are switched off, the pressure in all supporting bellows is hold.
</au>
<au ref="6">
In normal position the solenoid for the central pressurizing and venting of the valve block is switched off. Due to this the supply port 11 ist closed and the lower chambers are vented to 31.
</au>
<au ref="7">
When now the two other solenoids of the rear axle block are energized, the supporting bellows of the main axle are vented to 31, as well as the pneumatically connected supporting bellows of the lifting axle.
</au>
<au ref="8">
When the two solenoids are switched off again, the pressure in all supporting bellows is hold.
