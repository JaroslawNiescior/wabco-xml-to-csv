The ECAS ECU for trailers is an universal ECU and is provided in two variants only, which look nearly the same: as standard variants for all ABS trailers and as variant for trailers with the Electronic Brake System EBS.
</au>
<au ref="2">
Behind the base plate with the plugin-connections for all connected ECAS components and for power supply the actual electronics are located, which are not accessable.
</au>
<au ref="3">
Normally the ECU does not need to be opened, only when it is installed, during changes of the system configuration or to check the current paths.
