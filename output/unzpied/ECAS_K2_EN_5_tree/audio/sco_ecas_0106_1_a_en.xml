<au ref="1">
When using a 2-point control, like here on a semitrailer,  2 height sensors, one on each side of the axle, are installed.
</au>
<au ref="2">
In addition each side can be separately pressurized and vented.
</au>
<au ref="3">
In this way the load platform can be kept parallel to the axle, even if the load is one-sided.
