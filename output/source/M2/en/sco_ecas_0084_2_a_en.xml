<au ref="1">
This valve contains 3 solenoids:
</au>
<au ref="2">
One solenoid controls the central pressurizing and venting of the valve
</au>
<au ref="3">
... the other two the connections to each supporting bellow.
</au>
<au ref="4">
When the left soleniod is actuated, compressed air flows via port 11 to the inside of the valve.
</au>
<au ref="5">
When now the two other solenoids are simultanously energised, the ports 22 and 23 to the air suspension bellows get connected to air supply and the bellows are pressurized.
</au>
<au ref="6">
When the solenoids are switched off, the pressure in the two bellows is hold.
</au>
<au ref="7">
To vent the air suspension bellows the two solenoids on the right are energized. Thus the ports 22 and 23  are vented to 3 this time.
</au>
<au ref="8">
When the two solenoids are switched off again, the pressure in both bellows is hold.
</au>
<au ref="9">
If like here a front axle valve is connected to port 21, it it also pressurized and vented, via the central pressurizing and venting of the rear axle valve.
