Mark all correct statements regarding the advantages of the electronic air suspension system ECAS compared to conventional air suspension systems.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb1" fs="13" x="1002.45" y="36.8" wi="299" he="51.5">
That´s true. The control unit is able to achieve a desired height faster and more exact as it is possible via manual control.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="101.85" wi="332" he="56">
That´s wrong. Even using a conventional air suspension system the platform can be adjusted to the ramp height. However, it´s not performed automatically.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="171.85" wi="369" he="51.5">
That´s true. ECAS consumes less air, because the control unit recognizes whether the vehicle is in motion, and the driving level is readjusted no more than necessary.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="241.85" wi="313" he="56">
That´s right. During operation the control unit is able to detect error conditions, to react immediately and to store them internally for subsequent diagnosis.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb5" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="321.85" wi="293" he="56.95">
This statement is not correct, because also a conventional air suspension system is able to perform this. However, not so exact as ECAS can.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb6" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="391.85" wi="336" he="62">
That´s true. ECAS reacts at the push on a button. For instance a specific height stored in the control unit is automatically addressed, without annoying manual readjustment.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb7" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="-18.15" wi="355" he="23">
That´s right, you marked all appropriate statements.</tf>
