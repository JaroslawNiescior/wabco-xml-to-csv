Whether higher or lower depends on the design of the bellow.</tf>

Please mark the correct statement. After that click on</tf>

A load platform is raised by pressurizing the air suspension bellows, after that the air supply is closed. What´s the pressure in each bellow when raising is finished?</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb1" fs="13" x="992.45" y="64.85" wi="266" he="41">
Unfortunately this is wrong. Please consider the only variable the pressure depends on.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="993.45" y="124.85" wi="225" he="54">
Because the load remains unchanged, after raising the bellows pressure is the same.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="992.45" y="192.85" wi="188" he="39.9">
No, it is not influenced by design of the bellow.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb5" fs="13" x="990.45" y="-16.15" wi="256" he="39">
You are right. Because the load remains unchanged, the bellows pressure is the same after raising.</tf>
