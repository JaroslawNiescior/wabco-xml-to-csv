What means "parameterizing"?</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="33" fs="13" x="59.5" y="143" wi="273.5" he="220">
The vehicle manufacturer or a subsequent user is able to modify and permanently store certain values in the ECAS ECU using the diagnostic software. These values are named parameters, and changing them is called parameterizing.

Thus the ECAS system is attuned to the vehicle.

For instance it has to be declared using parameterizing whether a lifting axle is present and has to be controlled by ECAS, or not.</tf>

What means "calibration"?</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="43" fs="13" x="59.5" y="144" wi="269.5" he="284">
ECAS uses height sensors to detect the current level. Even when having the same vehicle and sensor type and the same level they provide different values, for instance because their mounting position is a little bit different.

Therefore each sensor has to be calibrated. This means: a certain level, e.g. the reference level during driving ("driving level") is exactly addressed, and the precise value measured by the sensor at this level is stored into the ECU.

That way the ECU is able to exactly address this level later on.</tf>
