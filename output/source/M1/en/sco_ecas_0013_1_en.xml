That´s wrong. Because the load applies more force to the bellows, the bellows pressure cannot be the same.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="101.85" wi="332" he="68">
This statement is true. The following formula is applied: pressure is force per unit area. Because the bellow´s cross section area remains the same and the applied weight force is increased, the pressure is raised.</tf>

This statement is true. The following formula is applied: pressure is force per unit area. Because the bellow´s cross section area remains the same and the applied weight force is decreased, the pressure is lowered.</tf>

Exactly, the bellows pressure is increased and decreased depending on the loading condition.</tf>
