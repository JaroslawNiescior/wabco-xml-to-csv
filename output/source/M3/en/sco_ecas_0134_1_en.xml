Please mark all the cases, where a plausibility error occured.</tf>

This is a typical plausibility error because during raising the count values have to be increased. The error can be caused by a wrongly mounted sensor lever. Or the bellow pressure is higher than the supply pressure whereby the superstructure is lowered.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="131.85" wi="260" he="40">
This behavior is correct: during raising the count values are increasing.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="201.85" wi="357" he="53">
This is a plausibility error because during raising the count values have to be increased. This error can occur, when the linkage of the height sensor is broken.</tf>

No, this fault is not included, because the ECU monitors and detects it directy. Plausibilitiy errors like a wrongly mounted sensor lever are only indirectly and during control processes detectable.</tf>

Exactly, you recognized the plausibility errors.</tf>
