When the vehicle frame is positioned below or above driving level, the steering behavior and the brake characteristics are influenced.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="2" fs="13" x="189.85" y="229.5" wi="343.15" he="55.5">
When the vehicle frame is positioned below driving level, the spring travel is decreased. Due to this the chassis and the frame may be damaged during driving.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="3" fs="13" x="189.85" y="299.5" wi="328.15" he="39.5">
Du to the reduction of the spring travel the cargo may be damaged.</tf>

This statement is true: The steering behavior and the brake characteristics are influenced by the distance between the axle and the superstructure.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="1000.45" y="71.85" wi="364" he="35">
This statement is true. Due to the reduced spring travel some parts of the vehicle may be damaged.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="1001.45" y="124.85" wi="318" he="39">
This statement is true. Due to the reduced spring travel even the cargo can be damaged.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="1003.45" y="179.85" wi="332" he="35">
This statement is wrong. Another level cannot cause so a pressure growth.</tf>
