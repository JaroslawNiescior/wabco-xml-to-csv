10;130;1;What does it mean, when after switching the ignition on the ECAS signal lamp shows steady light?
10;130;1;That´s wrong. Minor as well as severe faults are indicated by flashing.
10;130;1;No, that would be disadvantageous, because the ECAS signal lamp would be always switched on during driving.
10;130;1;On the trailer the steady light of the ECAS signal lamp means, that the superstructure is not on driving level.
10;130;1;Right, on the trailer the steady light of the ECAS signal lamp means, that the superstructure is not on driving level.

14;134;1;The ECAS ECU starts to address a higher level. In doing so, the count values of the height sensor decrease.
14;134;1;The ECAS ECU starts to address a higher level. In doing so, the count values of the height sensor increase.
14;134;1;The ECAS ECU starts to address a higher level. In doing so, the count value of the height sensor remains the same.

14;134;1;Please mark all the cases, where a plausibility error occured.
14;134;1;This is a typical plausibility error because during raising the count values have to be increased. The error can be caused by a wrongly mounted sensor lever. Or the bellow pressure is higher than the supply pressure whereby the superstructure is lowered.
14;134;1;This behavior is correct: during raising the count values are increasing.
14;134;1;This is a plausibility error because during raising the count values have to be increased. This error can occur, when the linkage of the height sensor is broken.
14;134;1;No, this fault is not included, because the ECU monitors and detects it directy. Plausibilitiy errors like a wrongly mounted sensor lever are only indirectly and during control processes detectable.
14;134;1;Exactly, you recognized the plausibility errors.

22;139;3;When raising and lowering the superstructure:Crushing and shearing hazard!
22;139;3;Also when raising and lowering the lifting axle:Crushing hazard!
23;139;4;The distance between the frame and the axle body can be suddenly changed during control processes:Crushing hazard!
23;139;4;Before wheel replacement: Deacticate ECAS by all means:
23;139;4;When the supply pressure is low, move the vehicle slowly and with caution, otherwise the vehicle and the ECAS system may be damaged!

24;140;1;Ensure that no one can trip over the diagnostic cable.
24;140;1;During diagnosis no one should come closer to the vehicle, since it could uncontrolledly move.
24;140;1;Measurings during calibration should be performed always from the workshop pit, never from the vehicle side.
24;140;1;When controlling compontents for testing purposes during diagnosis, it has to be ensured, that sufficient free space is available in all directions.
24;140;1;Because during ECAS diagnosis movements of the superstructure are triggered, it has to be ensured, that persons near to the vehicle cannot be crushed.
24;140;1;Confirm your selection with

24;140;1;Which of the following statements about required safety precautions during PC diagnosis of an ECAS system are correct?
24;140;1;This essential precaution in everyday live is also important during diagnosis, especially near the workshop pit.
24;140;1;That would be overstated. During some diagnostic operations, e.g. when calibrating the height sensors,  simultanuous operating near to the vehice is even required.
24;140;1;This statement is correct. Because the superstructure can be lowered operating from the vehicle side is too dangerous.
24;140;1;This statement is correct. The superstructure could ram something during raising, or touch down during lowering.
24;140;1;This statement is true. Mainly during lowering fingers can be crushed or even sheared.
24;140;1;Right, you marked the required measures.

25;141;1;You are currently addressing the memory level M1 using the remote-control unit. Suddenly you hear a bad sound.
25;141;1;What should you do as first?
25;141;1;No. When you do this blindly, a damage may be even increased.
25;141;1;No. Please consider, that the memory level would still be addressed, dou to a damage could be increased.
25;141;1;Your immediate action must be to stop the movement of the superstructure to prevent further damages of persons and materials.
25;141;1;You are right, your immediate action must be to stop the superstructure to prevent damages of persons and materials.
26;142;1;When the vehicle frame is positioned below or above driving level, the steering behavior and the brake characteristics are influenced.
26;142;1;When the vehicle frame is positioned below driving level, the spring travel is decreased. Due to this the chassis and the frame may be damaged during driving.
26;142;1;Du to the reduction of the spring travel the cargo may be damaged.
26;142;1;Otherwise the supporting bellows could burst during driving, caused by resulting pressure peaks.
26;142;1;Confirm your selection with
26;142;1;[ Ready ]
26;142;1;Before starting the driving level has to be achieved. Why?
26;142;1;Please mark all appropriate statements:
26;142;1;This statement is true: The steering behavior and the brake characteristics are influenced by the distance between the axle and the superstructure.
26;142;1;This statement is true. Due to the reduced spring travel some parts of the vehicle may be damaged.
26;142;1;This statement is true. Due to the reduced spring travel even the cargo can be damaged.
26;142;1;This statement is wrong. Another level cannot cause so a pressure growth.
26;142;1;Right, you marked the correct statements.

32;145;1;Here you can see the configuration of the ECAS system, e.g. the number and the application positions of the height sensors and the number of lifting axles.
32;145;1;In the Trailer ECAS diagnostic software the ECAS configuration is graphically displayed.The motor vehicle variants of the diagnostic software display a picture of ECAS system components at this place.
32;145;1;A green symbol indicates, that the data connection has been successfully established, otherwise the symbol is red.
32;145;1;Via the menu commands the related diagnostic functions are performed, including commissioning of the vehicle, treatment of messages, actuation of connected components for testing, measurement of values and setting of parameters.
32;145;1;Instead of using the menu commands it is quicker to use these icons.
33;146;1;Typical use cases
34;147;1;OK, it has been talked several times about faults and messages.And where can I find it?
35;148;1;The last detected and still pending fault is shown in red in the mainwindow of the diagnostic software.

38;149;1;Using the ECAS diagnostic software the faults which have been stored in the ECU can be readout and displayed as a list.
38;149;1;Which statements regarding the functions provided by this dialog window are correct?
38;149;1;Please mark the two correct statementsand confirm with
38;149;1;[ Ready ]
38;149;1;That´s right! You marked the two correct statements.
38;149;1;"This is not always the case. If a still existing fault has been recognized, the fault is displayed again, even if ""Delete diagnostic memory"" has been clicked."
38;149;1;"This statement ist true: currently detected faults have always a red background, even after ""Refresh""."
38;149;1;"This statement ist true: after ""Refresh"" the faults which have not been recognized again have a blue background."
38;149;1;"That´s not true: after ""Refresh"" all corrected faults have a blue background."
38;149;1;That´s not correct. It´s possible, that a fault is still existing but currently not detectable, for instance a loose contact.
39;150;1;Raising and lowering can be separately tested for each ECAS control loop.
39;150;1;"By means of the function ""Lamp test"" in the motor vehicle several lamp outputs can be checked."
39;150;1;In the trailer the ECAS signal lamp should always flash during diagnosis.
40;151;1;By the way, because they forgot to mention it here: during diagnosis the remote-control unit cannot be used. Raising and lowering works only using the software.And with the software you can check, whether the remote-control unit is alright.Even though it doesn´t work during this time, as I said before ...
