What does it mean, when after switching the ignition on the ECAS signal lamp shows steady light?</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb1" fs="13" x="992.45" y="84.85" wi="281" he="46">
That´s wrong. Minor as well as severe faults are indicated by flashing.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="992.45" y="161.85" wi="282" he="51.5">
No, that would be disadvantageous, because the ECAS signal lamp would be always switched on during driving.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="992.45" y="270.85" wi="332" he="43">
On the trailer the steady light of the ECAS signal lamp means, that the superstructure is not on driving level.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb5" fs="13" x="990.45" y="3.85" wi="313" he="52">
Right, on the trailer the steady light of the ECAS signal lamp means, that the superstructure is not on driving level.</tf>
