The terms "counts" and "timer ticks" mean the same. They are digital units in the range from 4 to 255.</tf>

Depending on the ECAS ECU, the signals of the height sensors are converted to counts or timer ticks.</tf>

Please mark all right statements:</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb1" fs="13" x="1002.45" y="36.8" wi="453" he="68">
This statement is wrong. In contrast to counts which are 8-bit values, timer ticks are 16-bit values in the range from 255 to 65.535. Timer ticks are used starting with newer 16-bit ECAS ECUs.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="1008.45" y="101.85" wi="349" he="23">
This statement is correct, indications in counts are 8-bit values.</tf>

This statement is correct, indications in timer ticks are 16-bit values.</tf>

That´s wrong. Conversion to counts or timer ticks is done by the ECU, depending on the actual ECU variant.</tf>

Right, you understood the meaning of the terms "counts" and "timer ticks".</tf>
