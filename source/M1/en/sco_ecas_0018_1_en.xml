During an ECAS control process a so called "overshooting" is used to reach the reference level in any case.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="2" fs="13" x="460.5" y="255" wi="215.5" he="39">
By pulsing the ECAS solenoid valve an overshooting is prevented.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="3" fs="13" x="460.5" y="305" wi="218.5" he="76">
The ECAS solenoid valve is pulsed, when after overshooting the actual level has to be readjusted to the reference level.</tf>

This statement is wrong. Overshooting is not wanted, for the very reason that the time is lost needed for readjusting in opposite direction.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb2" fs="13" x="993.45" y="88.85" wi="329" he="54">
Overshooting is prevented before reaching the reference level by pulsing the solenoid valve.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb3" fs="13" x="994.45" y="164.85" wi="361" he="38">
This statement is wrong. In this case a reversed control of the solenoid valve would be required.</tf>
<tf desc="mc" ref="fb4" fs="13" x="993.45" y="231.85" wi="360" he="57">
Right. By pulsing the solenoid valve before reaching the reference level overshooting is prevented.</tf>
